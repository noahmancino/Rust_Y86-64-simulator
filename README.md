# Toy: A Y-86-64 Machine Simulator in Rust

Y-86-64 is a minimal instruction set architecture designed for "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective" by Randal E. 
Bryant and David O'Hallaron. Toy simulates a system with only main memory and registers, interprets Y-86-64 instructions, 
runs them on the system, and displays the state of memory.

# Update:

Abandoned after realizing I would like to make this a web app instead of a terminal app and I am not interested in making a rust web application. Now doing the same project in python.
