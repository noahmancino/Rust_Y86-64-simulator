# Toy: A Y-86-64 Machine Simulator in Rust

Y-86-64 is a minimal instruction set architecture designed for "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective" by Randal E. 
Bryant and David O'Hallaron. Toy simulates a system with only main memory and registers, interprets Y-86-64 instructions, 
runs them on the system, and displays the state of memory in real time in your terminal.

 ### Why would I use this? 
 
 If you wanted to learn the basics of assembly language and working with registers, this might be a useful
 pedagogical tool. Really, though, it was just an excuse to start learning Rust.
